# Analysis-3-US-Drug-Seizures
Data analysis on drug seizures in the United States

Programs used for SQL queries and data visualizations:
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
Microsoft Power bi

The following is a dataset that compiles drug seizures
throughout the world. I decided to focus on just
the United States, which consisted on 1,073 total rows.
In a future analysis, I plan to compare the United States
with similar populated countries.
The queries I wrote to pull data are
listed below. These queries answered questions such as: 

Total seizures by year
Top drug seizures by decade
Drug type seizures
specific drug seizures

After executing SQL queries, I then took the data to Power bi
for data visualization.

The first charts display the total drug seizures from 1980
to 2019. Upon viewing, you can see a sharp increase in drug
seizures within the last decade compared to earlier decades,
with prescription opioids being the most prevalent drug.

The second page of charts show the top types of drugs that were
seized during a specific decade along with a total drug
seizures by decade.
